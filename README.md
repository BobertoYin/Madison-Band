 Madison Academic High School Band Program
===========================================

The Madison Academic High School Band Program began in 2003 when Madison originally opened. We contacted Mrs. Kristy White
and asked for her approval to launch the website. She was very enthusiastic about us creating a website and gave us plenty of visual media and important information to our website. Kristy White has been the band instructor at Madison since 2015 and has never launched a band website before.

The website was created by Robert Yin and Joseph Taylor to help both parents and students learn more about their school's band program.

 The Website
=============

- Our website looks great and is easy to navigate on all devices. We understand that there are a plethora of devices out there, and we     want our website to be accessible to everyone.

- We have lists of intruments assigned to their respective class, so that we can help students take the cources they need. We also provide cource descriptions and requirements, so that there is no confusion when choosing a class. We have four pages of the different band courses offered at Madison. They each have the name and picture of each instrument belonging to that course.

- Our website has a favicon and logo that are simplistic in style and easy on the eyes. The iconic swirls of the treble clef and the golden brass of the trumpet make our band logo one to remember.

- We have included a phone, email, and location link, to make contacting our band director quick and easy.
  
  
- We chose a simple, sans-serif font to aid in readability and simplicity. Our color scheme consists of a cardinal red and gold, which are school colors (the gold represents the brass of the band), and it helps with overall contrast and school spirit.. We use simple black text on a white background to keep things as visible as we can.

- The pages of our website are designed in two-column and three-column layouts to reduce scrolling and to better organize information. We found our inspiration in newpaper articles, which takes lots of information and makes it organized and easy to read.

-We always make sure we are up to date by highlighting recent band events, and by providing the most up to date documents for viewing or downloading.

- We included a PHP form for parents to sign up for the Band Booster Program. This way, they can become more involved by helping to acquire funds for the Band Program.

- We have a gallery page which can help viewers catch a glimpse of our performances and how good the Band Program at Madison really is.
  
- Thank you for taking the time to check out our website, we really appreciate it!
